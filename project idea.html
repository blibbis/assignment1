<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>My project idea is to create an App/ tool for builders and trades people to be able to easily enter materials and labour costs and it <br>
will calculate the cost of the job and give out a quote that they can then send on to a customer/client. This would cut costs and allow <br>
the user to be able to spend more time doing work to make money and be able to provide a more accurate quote.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>There are multiple products on the market but are very costly and hard to justify for a lot of small businesses. <br>
They also contain a lot of features that might be useless for smaller companies, so I want to create a simple easy to use program/app <br>
that is cost effective and provides consistent accurate quotes. From my experience, the more you provide accurate quotes, <br>
the more you win jobs and make profit instead of loses.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>With the app/tool I want to be able to create a cost effective platform where a user can enter items they use and costs associated with <br>
that item (timber = $3.28 per meter, labour $45 per hour etc.). The tool will then store that information so the user then just needs to add in what <br>
they need to use and they quantities and then it will automatically populate with the list of materials and hours, and also the total price of the project, <br>
which they can then send off to the client/customer.</p> 
<p>It will also be customized to the user, as it will only be loaded with the items that they need as when they first get the tool it will need to be loaded <br>
with the items that they want to load it with, with the prices that they want to set. This means that they can either choose to populate it with <br>
itemized lists of items they use, or populate it with a square meter rate if they wish to do that. This also means they will not be bound by any prices that might be <br>
pre-set and will also keep development costs down as they will be loading it themselves. This should also keep the program clear of unneeded clutter <br>
that could make the final product run slower.</p>
<p>This means it would be mainly aimed at small business as it would be time consuming and costly for big business to go through this process.</p>
<p>The tool would also allow multiple accounts so that companies can identify which employees are providing accurate prices, and then can train people in the <br>
areas they need training in to allow for a more efficient business. The tool would be in the form of a desktop program that could be used on any laptop or PC, <br>
as well as an accompanying mobile app that would allow for inputs to be made remotely and linked back to the desktop program. This allows for quotes to be put <br>
together at the they are entering the information, which I also another benefit as it allows the user the ability to provide a quote on the spot.<br>
This program would also provide the opportunity to easily look back and analyze previous jobs and see where they might be losing out and <br>
allow the user to fix these problems and become a more profitable and efficient business.

<h2>Tools, Technologies and Skills Required</h2>
<p>As it is a program, the technologies needed would be just an IDE, text editor or similar program to write the code for the program, <br>
and a program like MIT app builder to be able to build the mobile app. As I am new to all of this, I will need to develop the skills to be able<br>
 to write all the code in a language like java and also the skills to use and create a mobile app on a tool like MIT app builder.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>If successful, I will be able to provide a cost effective tool to trades business’s in need of a product that they can customize to suit <br>
their business and be able to spend more time in the field and less time quoting. They will also be able to be confident that they are able <br>
to provide more consistent, reliable to quotes to their customers/clients. This will hopefully also result in them winning more work as the prices <br>
they will provide will be accurate. The major drawback I see for this project are the lack of experience in coding and building an app, <br>
but this can be overcome with some training in those areas.
