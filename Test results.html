<p>
I got “the Logistician” in my 16 personalities test, the dynamo in the RMIT learning profile test and have also attached the results from my “my personality test”. <br>
I feel quite a few of the traits from the tests reflect my personality, so these results can help me better identify my strengths and weaknesses and can help me to improve as a team member. <br>
In my results it showed I am better suited to leadership roles, and am good at prioritising tasks which I can use to help my team if we get lost in an idea. <br>
It also mentioned that some of my weaknesses are that I can sometimes be stubborn or insensitive, so that will be something that I will be working on so I can help us succeed as a team. <br>
I think when forming a team I need to be aware to not partner up with to many other “logisticians” as this could cause clashes in personalities. <br>
I also need to pair up with more creative personalities as this is also an area I can lack in. <p///>
