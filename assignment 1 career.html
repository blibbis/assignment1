<hr>
<p>As I am new to this, I am not 100% set on any one roll as yet, but the roll I have chosen is an IT systems administrator and network specialist. <br>
The role is to be responsible for the day-to-day support operation and maintenance of PC’s, servers and any associated software and hardware. <br>
This position appeals to me as I enjoy problem solving and it would be a good broad base to start my career in IT. As I am new to the industry I <br>
would need to develop my skills in IT in general, and I feel by completing my degree in IT it will give me a good base to go into the industry and get some hands on experience.</p>
