<p>
The roll I have chosen is an IT systems administrator and network specialist. The role is to be responsible for the day-to-day support operation and maintain of PC’s, <br>
servers and any associated software and hardware. This position appeals to me as I enjoy problem solving and it would be a good broad base to start my career in IT. <br>
As I am new to the industry I would need to develop my skills in IT in general, and I feel by completing my degree in IT it will give me a good base to go into <br>
the industry and get some hands on experience. <p//>
