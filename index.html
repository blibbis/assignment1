<p/>
My name is Brendan Libbis and I'm a student at RMIT (student no. s3904714).<br>
My email address is s3904714@student.rmit.edu.au. <br>
I was born in Melbourne and have lived here my whole life. I completed year 12 at Upwey high school in 2005 and went on to do an apprenticeship in Carpentry.<br>
I enjoy playing golf and 2 dogs named Chewy and Leo.<p//>

I am looking for a career change into IT as I am looking for a new challenge, and IT is the perfect career path for that as it is an ever changing and evolving industry,<br>
with many different avenues of work to choose from. It is also an industry that will be around and only become more important as time goes on.<br>
Ive always had an interest in IT and love new technology. I also enjoy gaming in my spare time and have also built a couple of computers in the past.<br>
I choose to do my studies through OUA at RMIT as I am working fulltime and the ability to do the degree online will allow me to keep working fulltime and also study.<br>
I am expecting to gain the skills and confidence I need to successfully change careers into IT after successful completion of this degree.<p/>
